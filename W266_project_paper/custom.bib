 abstract = {I quantitatively measure the interactions between the media and the stock market using daily content from a popular Wall Street Journal column. I find that high media pessimism predicts downward pressure on market prices followed by a reversion to fundamentals, and unusually high or low pessimism predicts high market trading volume. These and similar results are consistent with theoretical models of noise and liquidity traders, and are inconsistent with theories of media content as a proxy for new information about fundamental asset values, as a proxy for market volatility, or as a sideshow with no relationship to asset markets.},

abstract = {Our research examines a predictive machine learning approach for financial news articles analysis using several different textual representations: bag of words, noun phrases, and named entities. Through this approach, we investigated 9,211 financial news articles and 10,259,042 stock quotes covering the S\&P 500 stocks during a five week period. We applied our analysis to estimate a discrete stock price twenty minutes after a news article was released. Using a support vector machine (SVM) derivative specially tailored for discrete numeric prediction and models containing different stock-specific variables, we show that the model containing both article terms and stock price at the time of article release had the best performance in closeness to the actual future stock price (MSE 0.04261), the same direction of price movement as the future price (57.1\% directional accuracy) and the highest return using a simulated trading engine (2.06\% return). We further investigated the different textual representations and found that a Proper Noun scheme performs better than the de facto standard of Bag of Words in all three metrics.},

abstract="The increasing practice of using social media as the basis for decision-making has made social media an important alternative information source. This is, in particular, true for investors in the stock market due to their needs to gain dynamic, real-time information and strategic persons' views. It is therefore very interesting to investigate the relationships between the sentiments of the text as published on social media and how they may influence investors' minds. In this paper, we selected several influential Twitter accounts, inc. Bloomberg, Forbes, Reuters, WSJ and Donald Trump, for sentiment analysis using SentiStrength. We found a fair amount of agreement between the sentiments as generated by the tool and those assigned from investors' point of view, esp. when plenty of positive words have been used in Tweets. However, we also discovered that not all Tweets with many positive words may generate positive sentiments in investors' minds. Furthermore, we identified interesting differentiated sentiments expressed in different Tweeter accounts that may indicate the stance of their holders, e.g. using an upbeat tone thus to promote economic growth; or being conservative, thus maintaining one's authority. Overall, we found many Tweets scored a neutral sentiment, as many of them contain references that their views cannot be determined without examining additional sources.",

abstract="The increasingly common practice by the public of using social media as an information source and basis for decision making for investment has given social media, such as Twitter, a growing influential role in people's behaviour. We investigate the impact of Tweets on the US stock market using sentiment analysis. We examine how the sentiments in Tweets influence the price movements in S{\&}P 500, an excellent indicator for the US stock market and economy in general. We compared the top five influential Twitter outlets and found WSJ, Bloomberg, Forbes, and Reuters consistently showed similar sentiments. We also discovered a significant two trading days' delay in impacting S{\&}P 500 trends where obvious agreements are found between the above outlets. An enhanced version of SentiStrength has been used where we injected finance-related lexicons underpinned by our investor's ontology to obtain a significantly improved and consistent performance.",

abstract = {Stock trend prediction plays a critical role in seeking maximized profit from the stock investment. However, precise trend prediction is very difficult since the highly volatile and non-stationary nature of the stock market. Exploding information on the Internet together with the advancing development of natural language processing and text mining techniques have enabled investors to unveil market trends and volatility from online content. Unfortunately, the quality, trustworthiness, and comprehensiveness of online content related to stock market vary drastically, and a large portion consists of the low-quality news, comments, or even rumors. To address this challenge, we imitate the learning process of human beings facing such chaotic online news, driven by three principles: sequential content dependency, diverse influence, and effective and efficient learning. In this paper, to capture the first two principles, we designed a Hybrid Attention Networks(HAN) to predict the stock trend based on the sequence of recent related news. Moreover, we apply the self-paced learning mechanism to imitate the third principle. Extensive experiments on real-world stock market data demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. A further simulation illustrates that a straightforward trading strategy based on our proposed framework can significantly increase the annualized return.},

abstract = {We propose a deep learning method for event-driven stock market prediction. First, events are extracted from news text, and represented as dense vectors, trained using a novel neural tensor network. Second, a deep convolutional neural network is used to model both short-term and long-term influences of events on stock price movements. Experimental results show that our model can achieve nearly 6\% improvements on S&P 500 index prediction and individual stock prediction, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods. In addition, market simulation results show that our system is more capable of making profits than previously reported systems trained on S&P 500 stock historical data.},

DOI={10.1609/icwsm.v8i1.14550}, 
abstractNote={ &lt;p&gt; The inherent nature of social media content poses serious challenges to practical applications of sentiment analysis. We present VADER, a simple rule-based model for general sentiment analysis, and compare its effectiveness to eleven typical state-of-practice benchmarks including LIWC, ANEW, the General Inquirer, SentiWordNet, and machine learning oriented techniques relying on Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, we first construct and empirically validate a gold-standard list of lexical features (along with their associated sentiment intensity measures) which are specifically attuned to sentiment in microblog-like contexts. We then combine these lexical features with consideration for five general rules that embody grammatical and syntactical conventions for expressing and emphasizing sentiment intensity. Interestingly, using our parsimonious rule-based model to assess the sentiment of tweets, we find that VADER outperforms individual human raters (F1 Classification Accuracy = 0.96 and 0.84, respectively), and generalizes more favorably across contexts than any of our benchmarks. &lt;/p&gt; }, number={1}, journal={Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media},
